The Clinical information and gene annotation for the GEO data was retrieved as follows:

1. The Gene annotation file to filter the GOYA data was downloaded from
   https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/info/geo2r.html (Human.GRCh38.p13.annot.tsv.gz).

2. For the NCICCR clinical data, we used the Supplementary Appendix 2 (Tab S9 Characteristics DLBCL) from:
   Schmitz, R., Wright, G. W., Huang, D. W., Johnson, C. A., Phelan, J. D., Wang, J. Q., ... & Staudt, L. M.
   (2018). Genetics and pathogenesis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. New England journal of medicine, 378(15), 1396-1407.

3. For the GOYA clinical data, the Clinical information was downloaded from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/geo2r/?acc=GSE125966
